                    A 2-D Platformer I worked on alongside 8 other talented programmers. We built the entire game engine from the 
                    ground up, and it is something I feel lucky to have been a part of. I personally was a member of the physics
                    engine team, so I specifically worked on box colliders, player movement abilities, portal creation, conservation 
                    of momentum, and level design.

                    This website!! I'm pretty early in the freelance web development game, and this is my first major project. I am 
                    tremendously proud of what I've created, and have learned more than I could have thought possible throughout
                    the proccess. The website is built fully with React.js for the frontend and Flask for the backend, but more 
                    details can be found on the github repo linked above.
